# Introduction
This age calculator will convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”.

Because dogs mature at a faster rate than us human. And this happen because time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. So, this app will help you find out how old would you be if you were a dog.


## Math!
* The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
